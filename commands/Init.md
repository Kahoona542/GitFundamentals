# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an git repository.

If you wanted to create a new directory and Initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
[git init](./commands/Init.md)
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./commit.md),
[push](./Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
